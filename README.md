# index_page
The aim of this project is to write a better index page for the okchakko translator project, under the MIT license.

## current url
The current index page is located at the following address:
https://www.okchakko.com/translate/index.php

This index page gives free access to the translation from French to Corsican, a language threatened with extinction. This index page allows you to choose the source language and the destination language for the translation, then makes a call to the translation API.

The current index page has several defects:
- it is basic, rather crude in its design on a white background
- the source-text and the destination-text should be aligned horizontally (like Google translate, Deepl, Apertium, etc.) and not vertically

## license
The index page index.php will be published under the MIT license.

# How to contribute?
Your contributions are welcome. You can help this project by proposing a better index page that the current one of the okchakko project (a priori the revision should concern the PHP part of the page code).

# General considerations

## project history
This project was initiated by philosopher [Paul Franceschi](www.paulfranceschi.com) in June 2022. It is a part of a more general project that aims to implement a multi-language translation system, especially for endangered languages: the okchakko project.

## project name
The name 'okchakko' comes from the endangered choctaw language and refers to a pale green or blue: there is no word for 'blue' or 'green' in the choctaw language but only 'okchamali', which refers to a vivid green or blue, and 'okchakko', which designates a pale green or blue. This emphasises that the taxonomies of colour in human languages are not identical, and reflects the cognitive diversity that characterises them.

As William Poundstone (*Labyrinths of reason*, 1989) emphasizes: 'A jeweler examines an emerald. “Aha,” he says, “another green emerald. In all my years in this business, I must have seen thousands of emeralds, and every one has been green.” We think the jeweler reasonable to hypothesize that all emeralds are green. Next door is another jeweler having equally comprehensive experience with emeralds. He speaks only the Choctaw Indian language. Color distinctions are not as universal as might be thought. The Choctaw Indians made no distinction between green and blue—the same words applied to both. The Choctaws did make a linguistic distinction between okchamali, a vivid green or blue, and okchakko, a pale green or blue. The Choctaw-speaking jeweler says: All emeralds are okchamali. He maintains that all his years in the jewelry business confirm this hypothesis.'

## priority pairs

With regard to endangered languages, priority pairs are the most wanted translation pairs for a given endangered language, in keeping with the main language with which it is associated (on a diglossia relationship). To take an example: French-Corsican is the priority pair for Corsican language. In the same way, Italian-Gallurese is the priority pair for Gallurese language, etc. Now expanding on that idea, priority pairs are: 

- Corsican: (i) French-Corsican (ii) Italian-Corsican (iii) English-Corsican
- Sardinian Gallurese: (i) Italian-Gallurese (ii) English-Gallurese
- Sardinian Sassarese: (i) Italian- Sassarese (ii) English-Sassarese
- Sardinian Logodurese: (i) Italian-Logodurese (ii) English-Logodurese
- Sicilian: (i) Italian- Sicilian (ii) English-Sicilian
- Manx: (i) English-Manx
- Munegascu: (i) French-Munegascu (ii) Italian-Munegascu (iii) English-Munegascu
